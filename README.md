## 📖 Overview

Predictive maintenance represents a **paradigm shift** in asset management, moving beyond reactive and preventive approaches.  
By leveraging continuous data acquisition, IoT connectivity, and machine learning, PdM minimises downtime, reduces costs, and extends the operational lifespan of industrial systems.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To **quantify the business impact** of PdM through visualised performance metrics.  
- To **compare maintenance strategies** (Reactive, Preventive, Predictive) in an accessible format.  
- To **illustrate the PdM technology stack**, including data acquisition, communication, analytics, and proactive action.  
- To **contextualise global adoption trends**, highlighting sector-specific and regional applications.
